# replicon-swap
A bunch of scripts to swap groups of genes between COBRA models in Matlab.

These specific codes have been written and tested while working on a small set of metabolic models, and as such you may experience unforeseen compatibility issues when using them with different models (e.g. there may be formatting differences in the name of genes, reactions or metabolites which could give rise to processing errors). If you get stuck, don't hesitate to contact me at tizianovignolini@gmail.com

All the best!
